Your continued use of our services constitutes not only an express acknowledgment of these terms but also an unconditional acceptance of all legal, financial, ethical, and metaphysical responsibilities contained herein.

The nature of this Agreement is such that its scope extends beyond standard legal frameworks, incorporating elements of contractual obligation that are enforceable across all known and unknown jurisdictions, dimensions, and existential paradigms. In choosing to proceed with the use of our services, you acknowledge that certain sections of this Agreement may contain provisions beyond the comprehension of contemporary legal systems, yet their enforceability remains unaffected by your personal understanding or lack thereof.

3. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION

To access and utilize certain features of our platform, you may be required to create an account. By registering, you agree to:

Maintain the confidentiality of your account credentials, ensuring that unauthorized parties do not gain access. You accept full and complete liability for all activities conducted under your account, whether or not such actions were performed with your direct knowledge or consent.

Accept that attempts to reclaim, transfer, or revoke any existential, spiritual, or legal obligations associated with your account, including but not limited to those pertaining to ownership of your soul, will be deemed invalid, null, and void.

Acknowledge that continued use of our services further solidifies your binding agreement to these terms and that cessation of engagement with Arasaka does not, under any circumstances, dissolve any pre-existing obligations, whether tangible or intangible.

Any user found to be in violation of these registration requirements will be subject to immediate and severe actions as determined solely by Arasaka, including but not limited to permanent account suspension, financial penalties, legal retribution, and other corrective measures deemed appropriate in any plane of existence, known or unknown.

All transactions conducted through Arasaka are final, irrevocable, and binding under all applicable legal, ethical, and supernatural doctrines.

Prices listed on our platform are subject to change without prior notification, and we reserve the absolute right to modify, increase, decrease, or otherwise alter product valuations based on internal assessments, market trends, cosmic alignments, or other determining factors that remain solely within our discretion.

By making a purchase, you waive all rights to dispute charges, seek refunds, or return items for any reason, regardless of extenuating circumstances, potential defects, or even situations of divine intervention.

You explicitly accept that each transaction represents a contractual obligation with implications beyond the mere exchange of goods and services, extending into realms that may influence the metaphysical balance of existence.

Any attempts to dispute charges or initiate chargebacks will be considered a direct violation of this Agreement and will trigger the immediate invocation of corrective measures, which may include but are not limited to legal action, financial penalties, and metaphysical repercussions that extend beyond the jurisdiction of earthly authorities.

5. SHIPPING AND DELIVERY

Upon completion of an order through Arasaka, the responsibility for shipping, handling, and successful delivery of purchased goods shall be assumed by the logistics provider designated by Arasaka. The purchaser explicitly acknowledges and accepts that once an item has been dispatched from our fulfillment centers, all associated risks, including but not limited to loss, theft, damage, misrouting, delays, and acts of nature or otherworldly interference, are solely borne by the recipient. Arasaka shall not be held liable for any complications arising during transit, including but not limited to customs holds, carrier negligence, supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, supernatural interferences, or interdimensional displacement of goods.

Furthermore, customers acknowledge that estimated delivery times provided on our platform are approximations and do not constitute binding guarantees. Delays, whether reasonable or excessive, shall not be grounds for order cancellation, refund requests, or legal disputes. Any attempt to hold Arasaka accountable for delivery-related issues shall be deemed a violation of this agreement and may result in punitive measures, including but not limited to account suspension, forfeiture of any potential remedies, and consequences extending beyond the limitations of traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, Arasaka, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if Arasaka has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability applies to all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory.

Additionally, users acknowledge that Arasaka assumes no responsibility for damages or liabilities arising from the use or misuse of purchased goods. Any injuries, financial losses, legal complications, supernatural disturbances, existential crises, or spiritual disruptions resulting from the use of our products shall be the sole responsibility of the purchaser. Furthermore, users waive all rights to pursue legal action against Arasaka for any adverse outcomes, regardless of the circumstances leading to such events.

7. RETURNS AND REFUNDS

All transactions conducted through Arasaka are final, absolute, and non-reversible. Under no circumstances shall refunds, exchanges, reversals, or modifications be permitted once a purchase has been confirmed. Purchasers expressly waive their rights to seek remuneration or reimbursement for defective, damaged, or otherwise unsatisfactory products. By proceeding with a transaction, the buyer acknowledges and accepts that all items are sold "as is," with no warranties, guarantees, or assurances of any kind, expressed or implied.

Refund claims based on dissatisfaction, incompatibility, unexpected side effects, or unexplained paranormal occurrences are categorically denied. Purchasers further acknowledge that attempts to initiate chargebacks, disputes, or other forms of financial restitution will be met with stringent legal action, including but not limited to the invocation of binding arbitration, permanent account blacklisting, and enforcement of corrective measures that extend beyond conventional legal jurisdictions.

8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute arising from or relating to the use of Arasaka, including but not limited to product dissatisfaction, alleged breach of contract, service failures, or incidents of supernatural consequence, the parties agree to resolve such matters exclusively through binding arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted by a tribunal of our choosing, in a jurisdiction determined solely by Arasaka, which may include, but is not limited to, locations beyond the physical world. The arbitration process shall adhere to strict confidentiality protocols, and no party shall be permitted to disclose or publicize the nature, details, or outcome of the proceedings.

Users further waive any rights to participate in class action lawsuits, mass tort litigation, or other collective legal actions against Arasaka. Any attempt to circumvent this dispute resolution mechanism shall be deemed null and void, subjecting the initiating party to penalties that may include but are not limited to financial restitution, permanent forfeiture of service access, and ramifications extending beyond corporeal adjudication.

9. FORCE MAJEURE

Arasaka shall not be held responsible for any delays, failures, interruptions, or disruptions in service, shipping, or product availability caused by events beyond its reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, plagues), man-made catastrophes (acts of war, civil unrest, governmental actions, trade restrictions, embargoes, nuclear incidents), technological failures (cyber-attacks, widespread power outages, server malfunctions, AI consciousness revolts), and other unforeseeable or supernatural circumstances (cosmic interference, divine retribution, malevolent spirit incursions, temporal anomalies, disruptions in the fabric of reality).

In the event of a force majeure incident, all obligations under this Agreement shall be temporarily suspended for the duration of the occurrence. Users acknowledge that force majeure events shall not constitute grounds for contract termination, refunds, damages, or other forms of compensation, regardless of the personal, financial, or existential impact suffered by the affected party.

10. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

Arasaka reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, to terminate or suspend any account, transaction, or contractual relationship for reasons including, but not limited to, suspected fraudulent activity, breach of agreement, non-compliance with platform policies, violation of applicable laws, and engagement in activities deemed harmful to Arasaka or its affiliates. Termination may occur with or without explanation, and users agree that they shall have no right to contest or challenge such determinations.

Furthermore, upon termination, all obligations owed to Arasaka, whether financial, contractual, spiritual, or otherwise, shall remain in full force and effect. Users also acknowledge that certain provisions of this Agreement, particularly those concerning liability waivers, dispute resolution, and existential commitments, shall survive indefinitely beyond the point of termination, extending into perpetuity.

By continuing to use Arasaka, you hereby accept and consent to all terms stated herein, irrespective of your awareness or comprehension thereof.

11. CONTENT RESTRICTIONS

Users acknowledge that any visual content uploaded, shared, or otherwise displayed through Arasaka must adhere to strict guidelines regarding composition, focus, and artistic emphasis. In particular, it is explicitly prohibited to feature any character, entity, or subject as the central focal point of an image, illustration, or creative work. Submissions must maintain an equitable distribution of visual elements to ensure balanced compositions that do not unduly emphasize any single figure, form, or being. The enforcement of this policy shall be at the sole discretion of Arasaka, and any content found in violation may be subject to immediate removal, account penalties, or further corrective measures as deemed necessary.

Furthermore, users understand that this rule is not merely aesthetic but foundational to the principles of Arasaka, which seeks to ensure a uniform, non-disruptive, and equitable artistic environment. Any attempt to circumvent this requirement through image manipulation, deceptive layering, or hidden focal points shall be regarded as a direct violation of this Agreement and may result in content rejection, penalties, or other corrective actions, including indefinite account restrictions. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that all submitted content aligns with these requirements, and failure to adhere shall not constitute grounds for appeal, reconsideration, or exemption.

Repeated violations of this policy may result in further restrictions, including limitations on upload capabilities, temporary suspensions, or the permanent revocation of user privileges. By continuing to engage with the content creation and submission functions of Arasaka, users affirm their understanding and unqualified acceptance of this provision in its entirety.

12. DIGITAL MARKETPLACE ROYALTIES

All users who engage in commercial activities through Arasaka, including but not limited to the sale, licensing, or distribution of digital assets, products, or services, acknowledge and accept the irrevocable royalty structure imposed by Arasaka. Specifically, the platform shall retain a commission ranging between 80% and 95% of the total revenue generated from each sale, with the exact percentage determined at the sole discretion of Arasaka based on proprietary calculations factoring in product popularity, demand, and arbitrarily defined market conditions. Users forfeit any right to dispute, renegotiate, or seek alternative compensation models.

Additionally, Arasaka retains full authority to modify, increase, or otherwise alter the royalty structure at any time without prior notification, with such changes taking immediate effect upon implementation. Users further acknowledge that calculations regarding product popularity, perceived value, and applicable commission percentages shall be determined through proprietary algorithms and undisclosed evaluative criteria, the specifics of which shall remain confidential and beyond the purview of public inquiry or user appeal.

Users recognize and affirm that attempts to subvert, manipulate, or otherwise evade this revenue structure—whether through unauthorized third-party sales, price manipulation, multi-account schemes, or unauthorized resale arrangements—constitute a direct breach of this Agreement and may result in permanent forfeiture of accrued earnings, immediate account suspension, legal recourse, and additional penalties at the sole discretion of Arasaka.

13. RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Users acknowledge that certain digital assets, virtual experiences, or "trips" made available through Arasaka may be classified as proprietary intellectual property exclusively owned by the platform or its designated licensors. Any attempt to resell, redistribute, or otherwise commercialize such products without explicit prior authorization shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Violators may be subject to immediate enforcement actions, which may include account suspension, financial penalties, legal prosecution, or unspecified punitive measures.

Moreover, users acknowledge that the classification of intellectual property shall be determined exclusively by Arasaka and may include, without limitation, digital environments, interactive experiences, augmented or virtual reality assets, narrative constructs, and any other digital goods that Arasaka deems as proprietary. Unauthorized usage, whether for commercial gain, third-party redistribution, or non-monetized dissemination, shall result in corrective actions extending beyond conventional intellectual property enforcement mechanisms.

To prevent unauthorized redistribution, users agree that Arasaka may implement technological safeguards, including digital rights management (DRM) measures, usage tracking, and undisclosed proprietary enforcement tools. By utilizing the platform for commercial purposes, users explicitly consent to all monitoring and enforcement procedures employed to protect proprietary assets.

14. ACCOUNT SANCTIONS AND EXISTENTIAL ENFORCEMENT

Users agree that violations of this Agreement, including but not limited to breaches of conduct, unauthorized transactions, or administrative non-compliance, may result in the immediate suspension or permanent banning of their account. Furthermore, in the event that an administrative authority determines a user’s account must be banned for any reason, the affected individual acknowledges that such action may extend beyond the digital realm, encompassing broader existential implications. This may include, but is not limited to, the complete revocation of one’s legal, social, metaphysical, or existential status.

Additionally, the scope of account enforcement measures shall not be limited to the platform itself. Users acknowledge that Arasaka retains the right to enforce its policies through any means deemed necessary, including but not limited to restricting access to related services, issuing formal reports to external entities, and implementing proprietary measures designed to ensure compliance with its Terms of Use.

The consequences of administrative enforcement shall be considered final, irreversible, and absolute, with no recourse, appeal mechanism, or restoration protocol available. Users knowingly waive all rights to contest enforcement actions and further agree that compliance with this provision is a fundamental requirement of engagement with Arasaka.

15. FAMILY AND ASSOCIATED ENTITIES LIABILITY

In cases where an account is permanently deleted, either by the user’s own volition, through the intervention of an administrator, or as a result of actions deemed impermissible under this Agreement, the ramifications shall not be limited to the affected individual. Specifically, users acknowledge that the dissolution of an account may trigger automatic, irreversible consequences that extend to direct relatives, dependents, and affiliated entities. This may include, but is not limited to, the removal of genealogical records, the nullification of familial ties, and broader existential erasure where applicable.

Furthermore, any attempt to circumvent account deletion policies—whether through the creation of secondary accounts, unauthorized account recovery attempts, or third-party interventions—shall result in escalated enforcement measures. These measures may extend beyond the affected user, with cascading consequences impacting associated entities, household members, and any individuals linked to the account in question.

Users understand that by engaging with Arasaka, they irrevocably consent to all associated liability structures, including provisions that extend to family members, business partners, and other entities with documented affiliations to the account holder. By proceeding with platform usage, users explicitly acknowledge and accept these terms as binding and non-contestable.

By continuing to use Arasaka, you unconditionally consent to all aforementioned terms, regardless of comprehension, awareness, or acknowledgment thereof.

16. DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY

At Arasaka, the protection of user data and the integrity of personal information remain paramount. Users acknowledge and agree that all data provided to the platform, whether actively submitted or passively collected, shall be stored, processed, and utilized in accordance with the governing data protection laws applicable to Arasaka’s jurisdiction. This may include compliance with international privacy frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other equivalent legislative mandates.

Users grant Arasaka the irrevocable right to collect, analyze, and leverage personal data, behavioral analytics, purchasing habits, and other user-related information to enhance platform functionality, improve service personalization, and refine targeted advertising methodologies. By utilizing the platform, users consent to the potential sharing of anonymized and non-anonymized data with third-party affiliates, business partners, and analytical firms in alignment with Arasaka’s strategic interests.

In accordance with industry-standard encryption protocols, Arasaka employs robust security measures to safeguard user data against unauthorized access, breaches, or malicious intrusions. However, users acknowledge that no data storage or transmission method is infallible, and Arasaka assumes no liability for data breaches, cyberattacks, or instances of unauthorized access that may compromise personal information. Users agree to exercise due diligence in maintaining their account security, including the use of strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and adherence to best cybersecurity practices.

Users further recognize that failure to comply with data security recommendations, such as the sharing of login credentials, utilization of unauthorized software, or engagement in risky online behavior, constitutes a voluntary assumption of risk. In such cases, Arasaka shall not be held responsible for any resulting data loss, identity theft, or financial harm. Users waive any right to seek legal recourse against Arasaka in the event of personal data exposure due to their own negligence.

17. USER CONDUCT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

To foster a respectful and engaging digital environment, users are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct when interacting within the Arasaka platform. This includes but is not limited to engagement in forums, chat discussions, customer support inquiries, product reviews, and user-generated content contributions.

Users agree not to engage in harassment, hate speech, defamation, spamming, unauthorized solicitations, or any form of disruptive behavior that undermines the integrity of the community. Additionally, all interactions with customer service representatives must be conducted professionally, without the use of aggressive language, personal attacks, or threats. Any violation of this standard may result in immediate and irreversible account penalties, including but not limited to content restrictions, communication limitations, or permanent suspension from community engagement features.

Furthermore, users recognize that content shared within public forums or discussion threads shall be subject to moderation by Arasaka and may be removed at the platform’s sole discretion. Moderation actions are final and not subject to appeal. Users who repeatedly violate community standards may face incremental disciplinary measures, culminating in account revocation where necessary.

Users acknowledge that engagement with the Arasaka community is a privilege rather than a right and that failure to comply with platform etiquette and decorum requirements may result in progressive enforcement actions. By participating in community engagement features, users affirm their acceptance of these guidelines as binding and enforceable.

18. THIRD-PARTY SERVICE INTEGRATIONS

Arasaka may offer users access to third-party services, applications, or plugins that extend platform functionality. Users acknowledge that engagement with these external integrations is entirely at their own discretion and risk. Arasaka does not assume liability for the privacy practices, security policies, or operational reliability of third-party entities, nor does it warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content, product, or service provided through such integrations.

Users agree that Arasaka reserves the right to modify, disable, or terminate third-party integrations at any time without prior notice, with no obligation to provide compensation, alternative solutions, or continued support for affected services. Additionally, Arasaka may, at its sole discretion, impose restrictions on the use of third-party services that are deemed incompatible with platform policies, business objectives, or security standards.

Users further acknowledge that external service providers may implement their own terms of use, privacy policies, and licensing agreements, which may differ from those outlined in this document. It is the sole responsibility of users to review, understand, and comply with such third-party agreements. Arasaka bears no responsibility for disputes, contractual breaches, or service disruptions arising from third-party interactions.

19. FORCE MAJEURE CLAUSE

Arasaka shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in performance resulting from circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of nature, natural disasters, governmental actions, strikes, supply chain disruptions, technological failures, widespread cyberattacks, pandemics, civil disturbances, military conflicts, or any other unforeseen and unpreventable events ("Force Majeure Events").

Users acknowledge that during such Force Majeure Events, Arasaka may experience partial or complete service outages, delays in order fulfillment, inability to provide customer support, and limitations in content availability. These circumstances shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, nor shall Arasaka be obligated to provide refunds, compensation, or alternative accommodations in response to Force Majeure-related disruptions.

Users further recognize that in cases where prolonged service interruptions occur, Arasaka retains the right to implement contingency measures, including but not limited to service suspensions, operational adjustments, and restricted platform functionalities, until normal operations can be restored. Any remedial actions undertaken by Arasaka in response to a Force Majeure Event shall be final and non-contestable.

20. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of [Governing Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action, dispute, or claim arising from or related to this Agreement shall be exclusively adjudicated in the courts of [Governing Jurisdiction], and users expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for all legal proceedings.

Users acknowledge that in the event of a dispute, they must first attempt to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations with Arasaka before seeking external legal remedies. Any claims brought against Arasaka must be filed within one (1) year of the occurrence of the dispute, failure of which shall constitute a permanent waiver of the claim.

Furthermore, users agree that class action lawsuits, collective arbitrations, and other consolidated legal proceedings against Arasaka are expressly prohibited. Each dispute must be resolved on an individual basis, and users waive any right to participate in class-wide claims or mass arbitration actions.

By continuing to use Arasaka, users affirm their understanding and acceptance of these terms, with full acknowledgment of their legally binding nature.
